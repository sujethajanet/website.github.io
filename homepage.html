              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Artificial intelligence (AI)</i></b> is<a href=""> intelligence</a> demonstrated by computers, as opposed to<a href=""> human or animal intelligence.</a><a href="">  "Intelligence"</a> encompasses the ability to learn and to reason, to generalize, and to infer meaning.<a href="">  AI applications</a> include advanced web search engines <a href=""> (e.g., Google Search),</a> recommendation systems (used by <a href=""> YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix</a>), understanding human speech (such as<a href="">  Siri and Alexa</a>), self-driving cars <a href=""> (e.g., Waymo)</a>, generative or creative tools <a href=""> (ChatGPT and AI art)</a>, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems <a href=""> (such as chess and Go)</a>.

               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in<a href="">  1956</a>, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding <a href=""> (known as an "AI winter")</a>, followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding.AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain,<a href="">  modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior</a>. In the first decades of the 21st century,<a href="">  highly mathematical and statistical machine learning</a> has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to <a href=""> solve many challenging problems</a> throughout industry and academia.
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The various sub-fields of <a href=""> AI research </a> centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include <a href=""> reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects</a>. General intelligence <b><i>(the ability to solve an arbitrary problem)</i></b> is among the field's long-term goals.To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including <a href=""> search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics</a>. AI also draws upon<a href="">  computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.</a>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence <b><i>"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"</i></b>. This raised philosophical arguments about  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by<a href=""> myth, fiction (science fiction),</a> and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; <a href=""> philosophy</a> antiquity.Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an <a href="">existential risk</a> to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards goals &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  beneficial to humankind.  Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; employment. The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.
